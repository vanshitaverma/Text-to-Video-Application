# Text-to-Video-Application

**Task:**
Use a programming language, LLM, and libraries of your choice to create a simple application that processes the sample prompts below and generates .mp4 video files:

1. Demonstration of nailing a standard nail into a block of wood using a claw hammer.
2. Demonstration of installing a screw into a block of wood using a power screwdriver, followed by uninstalling (unscrewing) the screw.
3. Adding gas from a gas can to a vehicle.

The program should allow the user to input a choice (1, 2, or 3) and generate the corresponding video.

**Bonus:**
Enable the program to accept free-form user input for a scene and generate an appropriate video.
